<p></p>

Zana GUI üïπÔ∏è. Zana üì¶ aims to be like Mason.nvim üß±, but maintained by the community üåà.

Zana is swahili for "tools" or "tooling".

A minimal package manager for Neovim (and other editors) which
uses the [Zana Registry][zana-registry] to install and manage packages.

Easily install and manage LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters.

<p></p>

Currently, Zana is in pre-alpha and under active development.

## Requirements

Zana is a TUI, therefore you need to have a terminal emulator available.

Besides that, we shell out to `npm`, `pip`, `cargo`, `go`, and `git` to install packages,
depending on the package type.

E.g. if you want to install `pkg:npm` packages, you need to have `npm` installed.

For the packages to work in Neovim, you need to
[Zana.nvim](https://github.com/mistweaverco/zana.nvim) installed.

## Install

Just head over to the [download page][download-page] or
grab it directtly from the [releases][releases-page].

## Usage

The heart of Zana is its `zana-lock.json` file.
This file is used to keep track of the installed packages and their versions.

Zana expects `zana-lock.json` to be in the following directories:

- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zana/zana-lock.json` or `$HOME/.config/zana/zana-lock.json`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/zana/zana-lock.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\zana\zana-lock.json`

If the file does not exist,
Zana will create it for you (when you install a package).

1. Start Zana by running `zana` in your terminal.
2. Use the arrow keys (or hjkl) to navigate the packages.
3. Use `enter` to install a package.
4. Use `enter` to update a package.
5. Use `backspace` to remove a package.
6. Use `/` to filter packages.
7. Use `q` to quit Zana.

It's advised to keep the `zana-lock.json` file in version control.

### Where are the packages?

Zana uses a basepath to install packages of different types.

The basepath is:

- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zana/packages` or `$HOME/.config/zana/packages`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/zana/packages`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\zana\packages`

The packages are installed in the following directories:

- `pkg:npm`: `$basepath/npm`
- `pkg:pypi`: `$basepath/pypi`
- `pkg:github`: `$basepath/github`
- `pkg:golang`: `$basepath/golang`
- `pkg:cargo`: `$basepath/cargo`
